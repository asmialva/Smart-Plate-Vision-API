# Smart-Plate-Vision-API
Vehicle number plate detection using Python and machine learning involves the development of a  system capable of identifying and reading vehicle registration plates from images or video streams.  This technology is crucial for applications such as automated toll collection, traffic law enforcement,  parking management, and vehicle tracking.The system utilizes image processing techniques to locate the license plate in an image, and optical character recognition (OCR) methods to extract the alphanumeric characters from the detected plate. Machine learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) Yolov8, are employed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the detection and recognition process. The implementation leverages libraries such as OpenCV for image processing, TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning, and Tesseract for OCR. The system's performance is evaluated on a dataset of vehicle images to ensure robustness across various conditions, such as 
different lighting, angles, and plate designs.
